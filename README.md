  <h3>BBraun Technical Challenge</h3>
  <p>
  <h4> Ideas for this challenge: </h4>
  <li> Fix all obvious mistakes with wrong syntax and wrongful use cases </li>
  <li> Separate classes and split private and public variables </li>
  <li> Determine the purpose of the program and implement my interpretation </li>
  <li> Implement some quality of life additions to the program, ideas: 
    <ul> Factory to create pointers (type one, two and three) </ul>
    <ul> Create a map for storing callback functions to have access to multiple at once </ul>
    <ul> Define a callback function with a template so to allow values such as integers, floats, etc. </ul> </li>
  <li> Write an improved test function to test the following: 
    <ul> Polymorphism across all three types of pointers </ul>
    <ul> Unique attributes of each type of pointer </ul>
    <ul> Copy and copy assignment constructor for TestClass </ul>
    <ul> Writing to file scenarios:
      <ul> Failed to write to file </ul>
      <ul> Failed to close file (*) </ul> </ul>
    <ul> Normal use cases of TestClass </ul> 
    <ul> Exceptions </ul> </li>

  <h4> What I actually did: </h4>
  <li> Fix all obvious mistakes with wrong syntax and wrongful use cases </li>
  <li> Separate classes and split private and public variables </li>
  <li> Implement some quality of life additions to the program, ideas: 
    <ul> Factory to create pointers (type one, two and three) </ul>
